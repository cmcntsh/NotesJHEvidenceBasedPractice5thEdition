## Chapter 6 Evidence Phase: Introduction to Evidence

* Evidence defined: The term evidence does not have a single definition, but in health sciences, it generally refers to information, findings, facts, knowledge, or data that are systematically obtained (Yu et al., 2024).
* Types of evidence
  * Pre-appraised evidence: secondary literature, methodical process for collection and evaluation used to produce, clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach, single studies with a formal study design, single studies with less formal design, anecdotal evidence
 
Prompt: determin if evidence is pre-appraised, single studies, or anecdotal

```
You are an expert in healthcare evidence-based practice. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text defines pre-appraised evidence as a group of individual studies that have undergone a methodical process for collection and evaluation by teams of investigators and content experts for quality and clinical utility. Examples of pre-appraised evidence include clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach and evidence summaries. Single studies may rigorous with formal designs, or less rigorous with less formal designs. Anecdotal evidence may include expert opinions, book chapters, position statements, case reports, programmatic experiences, and literature reviews without a systematic approach. Please categorize this literature as pre-appraised evidence, single study with formal design, single study with less formal design, or anecdotal evidence. Please also describe your rationale for your classification.
```

2. Determine a plan for performing the literature screening
3. Begin by screening only the title and abstracts produced from the search
4. Complete full-text screening for all articles that remain after screening titles and abstracts
5. Document the screening process

* Minimize bias in literature search and screening
  * Spectrum bias - inclusion/exclusion of specific population
  * Random error
  * Search satisficing - finish when something is found
  * Premature closure
  * Confirmation bias - rely on sources that confirm one's beliefs

Prompt: Rate the level of support for decision-making and appraise the quality

```
You are an expert in healthcare quality improvement project with extensive expertise in evaluating literature. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text defines pre-appraised evidence as a group of individual studies that have undergone a methodical process for collection and evaluation by teams of investigators and content experts for quality and clinical utility. Examples of pre-appraised evidence include clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach and evidence summaries. Single studies that are rigorous with formal designs may be described with the terms (randomized control trial, cluster randomized control trial, comparative effectiveness research, clinical trial, cross-over). Less rigorous studies with less formal designs may be indicated by the terms (time series design, pretest/posttest, case-control)). Anecdotal evidence may include expert opinions, book chapters, position statements, case reports, programmatic experiences, and literature reviews without a systematic approach and may be described with the terms (cohort, predictive modeling, tool validation, descriptive, correlational, case series, prevalence, natural experiment, retrospective, phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, focus group, thematic). Please categorize this literature as pre-appraised evidence, single study with formal design, single study with less formal design, or anecdotal evidence. Please also describe your rationale for your classification. In addition, please rate the level of support for decision-making. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text states the pre-appraised evidence is rated as "independent", that single studies with a formal design that includes controlled trials with or without randomization are rated as "strong", that single studies with a formal study design that includes interventional studies without control or randomization and observational designs are rated as "moderate", and that anecdotal evidence is rated as "limited".

## H Summary, Synthesis, & Best-Evidence Recommendations Tool

This tool has changed little from the fourth edition.

Prompt: Synthesized findings & Best-evidence recommendations (repeat this for groups of articles based on support for decision-making rating: strong articles, moderate articles, limited articles)

```
You are an expert in healthcare quality improvement project with extensive expertise in evaluating literature. I'm trying to answer this evidence-based practice question: "<Paste EBP question here in quotes.>" I'm completing Appendix H Section 1 Synthesized Findings. Please list the publications that are included in this analysis. In addition, for each publication, please categorize the publication as (pe-appraised evidence, rigorous single study, less-rigorous single study, anecdotal evidence) and provide the rationale for your classification. In addition, for each publication, please rate the level of support for decision-making as (independent, strong, moderate, limited) and provide the rationale for your rating. In addition, please rate the quality of the study as "adequate" or "inadequate" to inform the EBP project. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text defines pre-appraised evidence as a group of individual studies that have undergone a methodical process for collection and evaluation by teams of investigators and content experts for quality and clinical utility. Examples of pre-appraised evidence include clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach and evidence summaries. Single studies that are rigorous with formal designs may be described with the terms (randomized control trial, cluster randomized control trial, comparative effectiveness research, clinical trial, cross-over). Less rigorous studies with less formal designs may be indicated by the terms (time series design, pretest/posttest, case-control)). Anecdotal evidence may include expert opinions, book chapters, position statements, case reports, programmatic experiences, and literature reviews without a systematic approach and may be described with the terms (cohort, predictive modeling, tool validation, descriptive, correlational, case series, prevalence, natural experiment, retrospective, phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, focus group, thematic). The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text states the pre-appraised evidence is rated as "independent", that single studies with a formal design that includes controlled trials with or without randomization are rated as "strong", that single studies with a formal study design that includes interventional studies without control or randomization and observational designs are rated as "moderate", and that anecdotal evidence is rated as "limited".
Next, please cluster the publications by the level of support for decision-making (independent, strong, moderate, limited). For each cluster, please synthesize the information and generate insights that answer the EBP question. For each statement in the synthesis, please identify which publications support that statement.
Next, please consider all of the publication clusters and describe any additional insights, patterns, themes, subgroups, and subtleties that produce a more comprehensive understanding of the big picture.
Next, please construct a table that has two columns. The first column header is "Characteristics of the Recommendations". The second column header is "Best-Evidence Recommendations". The first row of the table should say, "High certainty recommendations (Robust, well-documented, consistent & persuasive, based mostly on evidence that provides strong support for decision-making)" in the first column. The second column in the first row should list relevant recommendations based on the evidence described in the relevant publications. Keep in mind, these can be recommendations FOR or AGAINST an intervention. Sentences can start with the phrases sugh as: "The evidence endorses...", "The evidence recommends...". Or sentences may end with: "...is recommended", "...is indicated", "...is beneficial", "...is useful". The second row of the table should say, "Reasonable certainty recommendations (Good, mostly compelling, consistent evidence, based mostly on evidence that provides moderate to strong support for decision-making) in the first column. The second column in the second row should list relevant recommendations based on the evidence described in the relevant publications. Sentences can start with phrases such as: "The evidence suggests...". Or the sentences may end with phrases such as: "...is reasonable", "...can be useful", "...can be effective", "...can be beneficial".
Next, please construct a table that has two column. The first column header is "Characteristics of the Recommendations". The second column header is "Recommendations Lacking Adequate Evidence". The first row of the table should say, "Reasonable to low certainty recommendations (Good but conflicting evidence. Inconsistent results, based mostly on evidence that provides moderate support for decision-making)" in the first column. The second column in the first row should list relevant recommendations based on the evidence described in the relevant publications in which one would have little confidence in endorsing. These can be recommendations FOR or AGAINST an intervention. Sentences can start with the phrases sugh as: "Evidence is mixed regarding...", "Evidence is conflicting regarding...", "There is little evidence to support...". Or sentences may end with: "...may not be useful". The second row of the table should say, "Low certainty recommendations (Little to no evidence. Information is minimal, inconsistent and/or based mostly on evidence that provides limited support for decision-making)" in the first column. The second column in the first row should list relevant recommendations based on the evidence described in the relevant publications in which one would have no confidence in endorsing. Sentences can start with the phrases sugh as: "There is no evidence to support...", "Evidence is very limited on...", "Recommendations cannot be made on...". Or sentences may end with: "...is not supported by evidence".
