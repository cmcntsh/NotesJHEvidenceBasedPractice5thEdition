# Part 1 Evidence-Based Practice Overview

## Chapter 1 EBP: Past, Present, Future

* EBP Defined: EBP is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making that integrates the best available scientific evidence with the best available experiential (patient and practitioner) evidence and encourages critical thinking in the judicious application of such evidence to the care of individual patients, a patient population, or a system (Dang et al., 2022).
* The Past (some history)
  * IOM reports related to EBP
  * Crossing the Quality Chasm (IOM, 2001)
  * Health Professions Education: A Bridge to Quality (IOM, 2003)
  * Roundtable on Evidence-Based Medicine (IOM, 2007)
  * The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health (IOM, 2011)
  * The Future of Nursing 2020–2030: Charting a Path to Achieve Health Equity (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2021)
* The Present
* The Future: Emerging Trends
  * AI
  * Health Equity

## Chapter 2 JHEBP Model for Nurses and Healthcare Professionals

* Differentiating between quality improvement, research, and EBP See Table 2.1 on page 18, Figure 2.1 on page 20
* Description: The JHEBP Model
* JHEBP PET Process: Practice Question, Evidence, and Translation See Figure 2.4 on page 27, See Appendix A on page 208

1. (Practice Question) Explore and describe the problem
2. (Practice Question) Develop the problem statement
3. (Practice Question) Write the EBP question (Population, Setting, Topic or Intervention, Outcomes)
4. (Evidence) Conduct best-evidence search and appraisal
5. (Evidence) Conduct targeted search or exhaustive search and screening
6. (Evidence) Appriase the evidence
7. (Evidence) Summarize the evidence
8. (Evidence) Organize the data
9. (Evidence) Synthesize the findings
10. (Evidence) Record best-evidence recommentations
11. (Translation) Assess the risk, fit, feasibility, and acceptability of best-evidence recommendations
12. (Translation) Identify practice setting-specific recommendations
13. (Translation) Identify implementation framework
14. (Translation) Create an implementation/action plan
15. (Translation) Implement
16. (Translation) Monitor sustainability and identify next steps

* Ongoing Considerations (Keep in mind at all phases.)
  * Maintain project plan, including timeline and responsibilities
  * Teams and impacted groups
  * Monitor alignment with organizational priorities
  * Communication and dissemination

# Part 2 Practice Question, Evidence, Translation (PET)

## Chapter 3 Practice Question Phase: The Problem

* Explore the problem (or question)
  * problem-focused triggers
  * knowledge-focuesed triggers
* Describe the problem
  * Describe in precise terms the perceived gap between what one sees adn what one wants to see.
  * See table 3.2 starting on page 45
* Pitfall 1: Approaching with a solution in mind
* Pitfall 2: Focusing on the symptoms of the problem
* Pitfall 3: accepting the first problem identified
* Techniques for conducting a root cause analysis Table 3.4 on page 49
  * Brainstorming
  * The 5 whys
  * Mind Mapping
  * Ishikawa Fishbone Diagram
  * Affinity Diagram
  * Relation Diagram
* Develop the problem statement See Appendix B on page 212

## Chapter 4 Practice Question Phase: The EBP Question

* Background (broad) questions
* Foreground (specific) questions
* PICO (Patient/Population/Problem, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) questions vs EBP questions
  * PICO works well for foreground questions
* EBP questions
  * EBP works well for background questions or when intervention is unknown
* Other question development framworks are available. p. 57
* Broad EBP question
* Intervention EBP question
* See Appendix B on page 212
* Additional Considerations
  * Addressed by existing literature
  * If there is little to no literature available, consider conducting a research study
  * Does the problem or focus align with the organization's priorities?

## Chapter 5 The Interprofessional Team

* The EBP Team
  * Multiple disciplines
  * Respect goals and values
 
1. Choose team members
  * Expertise - different skills
  * Level of influence
  * Character traits - 10 faces of innovation
  * Behavior traits - diffusion of innovations theory
    * Innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards
    * 5 critical factors: psychological safety, mutual trust, structure and clarity, meaning, impact
2. Designate a team leader
3. Identify impacted groups: include on team
  * Competencies: leader with clear direction, suitable mix if skills, interdisciplinary competencies, interdependence balenced with autonomy, values, enhance intra-team communication, team culture, adequate time and resources, high-quality recommendations, encourage personal development
4. The first meeting: everyone fully informed
5. Maintain team engagement and accountability
  * care, connect, coach, contribute, congratulate

## Chapter 6 Evidence Phase: Introduction to Evidence

* Evidence defined: The term evidence does not have a single definition, but in health sciences, it generally refers to information, findings, facts, knowledge, or data that are systematically obtained (Yu et al., 2024).
* Types of evidence
  * Pre-appraised evidence: secondary literature, methodical process for collection and evaluation used to produce, clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach, single studies with a formal study design, single studies with less formal design, anecdotal evidence
 
Prompt: determin if evidence is pre-appraised, single studies, or anecdotal

```
You are an expert in healthcare evidence-based practice. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text defines pre-appraised evidence as a group of individual studies that have undergone a methodical process for collection and evaluation by teams of investigators and content experts for quality and clinical utility. Examples of pre-appraised evidence include clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach and evidence summaries. Single studies may rigerous with formal designs, or less rigerous with less formal designs. Anecdotal evidence may include expert opinions, book chapters, position statements, case reports, programmatic experiences, and literature reviews without a systematic approach. Please categorize this literature as pre-appraised evidence, single study with formal design, single study with less formal design, or anecdotal evidence. Please also descibe your rationale for your classification.

## A EBP Project Steps and Overview

## B Question Development Tool

* What is the local problem?
* Why is this problem important and relevant?
* What is the current practice in the EBP team's setting?
* What data from the EBP team's setting indicate there is a problem?
* Will this be a broad or intervention EBP question?

* Identify the relevant elements of the EBP question
  * Population
  * Setting
  * Topic or Intervention
  * Outcomes
 
* Construct the EBP question
  * Broad: In/among <population or setting>, what are best practices/strategies/interventions for/regarding <topic>?
  * Intervention: According to evidence, in/among <population or setting>, what is the impact of <intervention> on <outcome>?
* If needed, revise EBP question after preliminary evidence search/review.
