# Part 1 Evidence-Based Practice Overview

## Chapter 1 EBP: Past, Present, Future

* EBP Defined: EBP is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making that integrates the best available scientific evidence with the best available experiential (patient and practitioner) evidence and encourages critical thinking in the judicious application of such evidence to the care of individual patients, a patient population, or a system (Dang et al., 2022).

* The EBP Team
  * Multiple disciplines
  * Respect goals and values
 
1. Choose team members
  * Expertise - different skills
  * Level of influence
  * Character traits - 10 faces of innovation
  * Behavior traits - diffusion of innovations theory
    * Innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards
    * 5 critical factors: psychological safety, mutual trust, structure and clarity, meaning, impact

  * care, connect, coach, contribute, congratulate

## Chapter 6 Evidence Phase: Introduction to Evidence

* Evidence defined: The term evidence does not have a single definition, but in health sciences, it generally refers to information, findings, facts, knowledge, or data that are systematically obtained (Yu et al., 2024).
* Types of evidence
  * Pre-appraised evidence: secondary literature, methodical process for collection and evaluation used to produce, clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach, single studies with a formal study design, single studies with less formal design, anecdotal evidence
 
Prompt: determin if evidence is pre-appraised, single studies, or anecdotal

```
You are an expert in healthcare evidence-based practice. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text defines pre-appraised evidence as a group of individual studies that have undergone a methodical process for collection and evaluation by teams of investigators and content experts for quality and clinical utility. Examples of pre-appraised evidence include clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach and evidence summaries. Single studies may rigerous with formal designs, or less rigerous with less formal designs. Anecdotal evidence may include expert opinions, book chapters, position statements, case reports, programmatic experiences, and literature reviews without a systematic approach. Please categorize this literature as pre-appraised evidence, single study with formal design, single study with less formal design, or anecdotal evidence. Please also descibe your rationale for your classification.
```

## Chapter 7 Evidence Phase: The Evidence Search and Screening

* Best-Evidence search

1. Identify elements of the EBP question to search: population, setting, topic, intervention, outcome
2. Identify resources for pre-appraised evidence: Cochrane Library, JBI, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), US Preventive Services Taskforce (USPSTF), Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), and World Health Organization (WHO), professional organizations (American Academy of Pediatrics, American Heart Association, International Council of Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation), ECRI (Emergency Care Research Institute) Guidelines Trust, Guideline Central See table 7.2 on page 96
3. Execute the search
4. Evaluate the search results
5. If applicable, conduct a targeted search

* Exhaustive search

1. Determine which databases to search
2. Build the search - identify key concepts
3. Build the search - create search strings
4. Execute the search
5. When appropriate, apply initial limits or filters
6. Evaluate, revise, adn refine the search
7. Document the search

* Systematic literature screening

1. Establish inclusion and exclusion criter for the literature screening
2. Determine a plan for performing the literature screening
3. Begin by screening only the title and abstracts produced from the search
4. Complete full-text screening for all articles that remain after screening titles and abstracts
5. Document the screening process

* Minimize bias in literature search and screening
  * Spectrum bias - inclusion/exclusion of specific population
  * Random error
  * Search satisficing - finish when something is found
  * Premature closure
  * Confirmation bias - rely on sources that confirm one's beliefs
  * Attribute substitution - oversimplification
  * Not invented here - focus on own country or area

## Chapter 8 Evidence Phase: Appraising the Evidence

* Overview: 1) determine level of support for decision making, 2) assess the quality of evidence

Prompt: Rate the level of support for decision-making and appraise the quality

```
You are an expert in healthcare quality improvement project with extensive expertise in evaluating literature. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text defines pre-appraised evidence as a group of individual studies that have undergone a methodical process for collection and evaluation by teams of investigators and content experts for quality and clinical utility. Examples of pre-appraised evidence include clinical practice guidelines, literature reviews with a systematic approach and evidence summaries. Single studies that are rigerous with formal designs may be described with the terms (randomized control trial, cluster randomized control trial, comparative effectiveness research, clinical trial, cross-over). Less rigerous studies with less formal designs may be indicated by the terms (time series design, pretest/posttest, case-control)). Anecdotal evidence may include expert opinions, book chapters, position statements, case reports, programmatic experiences, and literature reviews without a systematic approach and may be described with the terms (cohort, predictive modeling, tool validation, descriptive, correlational, case series, prevalence, natural experiment, retrospective, phenomenology, ethnography, grounded theory, docus group, thematic). Please categorize this literature as pre-appraised evidence, single study with formal design, single study with less formal design, or anecdotal evidence. Please also descibe your rationale for your classification. In addition, please rate the level of support for decision-making. The Johns Hopkins Evidence-Based Practice 5th edition text states the pre-appraised evidence is rated as "independent", that single studies with a formal design that includes controlled trials with or without randomization are rated as "strong", that single studies with a formal study design that includes interventional studies without control or randomization and observational designs are rated as "moderate", and that anecdotal evidence is rated as "limited". In addition, if there is a formal study design, please state what it is. In addition, please rate the quality of the study as "adequate" or "inadequate" to inform the EBP project.
