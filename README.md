# Part 1 Evidence-Based Practice Overview

## Chapter 1 EBP: Past, Present, Future

* EBP Defined: EBP is a problem-solving approach to clinical decision-making that integrates the best available scientific evidence with the best available experiential (patient and practitioner) evidence and encourages critical thinking in the judicious application of such evidence to the care of individual patients, a patient population, or a system (Dang et al., 2022).
* The Past (some history)
  * IOM reports related to EBP

  * Health Equity

## Chapter 2 JHEBP Model for Nurses and Healthcare Professionals

* Differentiating between quality improvement, research, and EBP See Table 2.1 on page 18, Figure 2.1 on page 20
* Description: The JHEBP Model
* JHEBP PET Process: Practice Question, Evidence, and Translation See Figure 2.4 on page 27

1. (Practice Question) Explore and describe the problem
2. (Practice Question) Develop the problem statement
3. (Practice Question) Write the EBP question (Population, Setting, Topic or Intervention, Outcomes)
4. (Evidence) Conduct best-evidence search and appraisal
5. (Evidence) Conduct targeted search or exhaustive search and screening
6. (Evidence) Appriase the evidence
7. (Evidence) Summarize the evidence
8. (Evidence) Organize the data
9. (Evidence) Synthesize the findings
10. (Evidence) Record best-evidence recommentations
11. (Translation) Assess the risk, fit, feasibility, and acceptability of best-evidence recommendations
12. (Translation) Identify practice setting-specific recommendations
13. (Translation) Identify implementation framework
14. (Translation) Create an implementation/action plan
15. (Translation) Implement
16. (Translation) Monitor sustainability and identify next steps

* Ongoing Considerations (Keep in mind at all phases.)
  * Maintain project plan, including timeline and responsibilities
  * Teams and impacted groups
  * Monitor alignment with organizational priorities
  * Communication and dissemination
